üìù To add a new page, create a new Markdown file in the root directory of this repository. Be sure to use "-" in the file name instead of spaces. Also, make sure to add a link to the corresponding section in the `_sidebar.md` file index so that it can be discovered. Use double brackets around the file name, without the extension and *spaces*, to create a page link.

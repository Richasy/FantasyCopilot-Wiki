# Welcome to Fantasy Copilot Wiki

We extend our warmest welcome to you for joining us. Let's define our own workflow in the way we want it to be!

On the right-hand side, you can find information about "Workflow," "Module Description," "How to Contribute," "How to Participate in Development," and more.

*Of course, if you find no content inside, it means that the module is still under construction üèóÔ∏è.*
